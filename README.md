# **Financial Data Exploration: NIFTY50 Case Study**

## **Overview**  
This project presents an exploratory analysis of the **NIFTY50 Index**, which represents 50 major companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). Although the dataset focuses on the Indian market, the analytical process used here examining returns, volatility, and risk-adjusted performance can be applied to financial data from any market globally.  

The analysis focuses on understanding stock behavior, assessing market risk, and evaluating portfolio performance through statistical and financial metrics. It demonstrates how financial data analysis techniques can support investment insights and decision-making.

## **Objectives**  
The primary objectives of this analysis were to:  
- Examine **daily price movements** and calculate **daily returns** for each stock.  
- Assess **volatility** to understand the degree of price fluctuation across the 24-day period.  
- Evaluate **risk-adjusted returns** using the **Sharpe Ratio**.  
- Explore **technical indicators** such as the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** and **Bollinger Bands** to detect potential price trends and momentum.  
- Summarize key insights that reflect overall **market stability and portfolio behavior**.

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset consists of **24 days of historical closing prices** for 50 companies that form the NIFTY50 Index. Each column represents a stock, while the “Date” column corresponds to trading days.  
Although the timeframe is short, it provides a simplified framework for learning how to calculate and interpret core financial metrics in portfolio analysis.

## **Methodology**  
The analysis followed a structured approach using Python for financial computation and visualization:  

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset to ensure consistent column formatting.  
   - Converted date columns to datetime format for time-series operations.  

2. **Descriptive Statistics:**  
   - Computed mean, median, standard deviation, and other summary statistics to understand stock behavior.  

3. **Daily Returns and Volatility:**  
   - Calculated daily returns to measure percentage changes in prices.  
   - Analyzed volatility using standard deviation to capture fluctuations across different stocks.  

4. **Risk and Performance Metrics:**  
   - **Sharpe Ratio:** Evaluated how much return was earned per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicated more efficient risk-taking.  
   - **Value at Risk (VaR):** Estimated the potential maximum loss at a given confidence level.  
   - **RSI and Bollinger Bands:** Used as technical indicators to identify overbought/oversold conditions and price range tendencies.  

5. **Visualization:**  
   - Created line charts for stock price trends and moving averages.  
   - Illustrated return distributions and volatility comparisons to reveal market patterns.

## **Key Insights**  
- **Returns:** Stocks exhibited varying levels of daily returns, with a few showing consistent short-term growth while others experienced sharp reversals.  
- **Volatility:** High volatility indicated increased uncertainty within the short trading window, a common feature in dynamic equity markets.  
- **Sharpe Ratio:** The portfolio’s Sharpe Ratio provided insight into how effectively returns compensated for the level of risk assumed.  
- **Technical Indicators:** RSI and Bollinger Bands helped identify temporary overbought and oversold zones, reflecting potential entry and exit points for traders.  
- **Market Interpretation:** Overall patterns suggested short-term instability with identifiable clusters of correlated movement among certain sectors.

## **Conclusion**  
The objectives of the analysis were successfully achieved. Through the exploration of NIFTY50 stock data, key metrics such as returns, volatility, Sharpe Ratio, and RSI provided a comprehensive understanding of market behavior and risk dynamics.  
Although based on a limited timeframe, the findings highlight the importance of quantitative measures in guiding data-driven financial decisions.
